## Tech stack & Open-source libraries
- Minimum SDK Level 16
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) based.
- [Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) for dependency injection.
- Jetpack
  - Lifecycle - Observe Android lifecycles and handle UI states upon the lifecycle changes.
  - ViewModel - Manages UI-related data holder and lifecycle aware. Allows data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations.
  - ViewBinding - Generates a binding class for each XML layout file that allows you to more easily write code that interacts with views.
  - Room Persistence - Constructs Database by providing an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access.
- [Retrofit2 & OkHttp3](https://github.com/square/retrofit) - Construct the REST APIs.
- [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) & [RxAndroid](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxAndroid) - For asynchronous programming with observable streams.
- [RxBinding](https://github.com/JakeWharton/RxBinding) - RxJava binding APIs for Android UI widgets.
- [Lottie](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android) - Parses Adobe After Effects animations exported as json with Bodymovin and renders them natively on mobile.

## Architecture
Currency Converter is based on the MVVM architecture and the Repository pattern.
